# Scuffed-Mario
Tried to create Mario in Python using Pygame-ce as a learning experience

The project is currently paused as I got what I wanted out of it. (I might finish it when I have time)

What I learned:
* Familiarised with pygame-ce and got better at Python
* Reading data from different tools and using that to create levels
* how to load sprite sheets and cut them up to create animations
